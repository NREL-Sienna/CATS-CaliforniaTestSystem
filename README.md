## Description
This repository contains the data files of a geographically-accurate synthetic grid that is located in California. This grid was created using publicly available geographic data of California's actual transmission lines, substations, and power plants, which we supplemented with invented connections and parameters that are "realistic but not real".

## Usage
Clone the repository
```julia
   git clone https://github.com/WISPO-POP/SyntheticCaliforniaGrid.git
```

## Citation
If you use this repository, please cite our publication:
```Reference will be added soon.```

## Contents of this repository
Key files and folders of this repository are highlighted below.

* **cal_largest_grid.m** -- MATPOWER file of the largest connected grid

## Roadmap

- Add renewable generation scenarios
- Revisit load assignment
- Convert MATLAB code to Julia

See the [open issues](https://github.com/WISPO-POP/WildfireMapData/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
